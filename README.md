iOS location consolidated.db -> KML conversion script

Having watched the media storm over the iPhone location database erupt in the last few days, I wonder why I didn't release this before. First credit should go to Chris Vance and Nathan Broslawsky who discovered this in Sept 2010 - they were extremely helpful when I contacted them for advice in a forensics case. We all kept quiet in the interests of "responsible disclosure" - ah well.
